# Lorna McGinley - Python Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of the worksheets and projects I completed during the learning, and development of my Python coding skills with futureCoders.

The *Worksheets* folder contains a number of worksheets that I completed which introduced and helped me learn python and gain a good knowledge of the python coding language, functions and using what I learnt to perform data analysis.

### The *Projects* folder contains a number of projects that I completed during my learning:
- Air Quality Mini Project - I have worked and investigated data with air quality to clean, sort and wrangle it. I then presented datasets relating to air quality.

- NumPy (Mini Project) - I have worked with, investigated, wrangled, added new data to the dataframe and then proceeded to filter and correlate data series relating to exam scores.

- Sea Level Project - I have worked with data on rising sea levels, cleaned it and visualised it, and I have used linear regression to help to predict sea levels up to 2050.

- Sea Level NumPy Project - Using numpy I looked for a correlation between time data and sea level rise.
